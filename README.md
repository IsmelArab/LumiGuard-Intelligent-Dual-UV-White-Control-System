# LumiGuard-Intelligent-Dual-UV-White-Control-System

# Project Objective:

LumiGuard's goal is to provide a comprehensive solution for applications that require:

Efficient UV disinfection: Using short-wavelength ultraviolet light (275 nm) to eliminate pathogens without risk to operators.

Adjustable white lighting: For real-time process visualization.

Smart security: Proximity detection automatically deactivates UV light if an operator approaches.

Energy efficiency: PWM control of LEDs and low-power mode.


# Key Components and Technologies:

The heart of LumiGuard integrates modern technologies and high-quality components:

ATtiny85 Microcontroller:

The brain of the system manages operating modes, PWM signals, and I2C communication.

VCNL4040 Proximity Sensor:

Detects human presence up to 20 cm away, activating safety protocols.

Specialized LEDs:

UV (275 nm): For disinfection.

White (5630 SMD): For cool, adjustable lighting.

MOSFET Control (DMN3010LSS):

Adjusts light intensity via PWM, minimizing energy losses

Professional PCB Design:

2 layers with a solid ground plane.

Noise filtering, analog/digital separation, and custom silkscreen printing.

Programming Interface (USBasp):

ISP connector for firmware updates.
